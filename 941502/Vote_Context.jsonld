    "comment": "I am voting NO on this proposal. An increase in APY of ~0.5 (~4% to ~4.5%) will not have a noticeable benefit for the vast majority of ADA holders. However, it will significantly reduce treasury income. The proposal's rationale relies on \"higher ADA prices.\" While all the reasoning follows given higher ADA prices, a government should not assume best possible outcomes. Cardano governance must remain resilient especially as price fluctuates down.\n\nFurthermore, it is too early in the governance process to begin to restrict the treasury funds. I believe we should be frugal in our treasury spending, but I do not believe we should be restrictive. Since the proposed constitution (still being voted on) prohibits changes to the `treasuryCut` more often than once ever 6 months, we should wait to consider reducing the treasuryCut until we've already gone through at least one treasury withdrawal and seen the result. If as a community we are very aggressive with spending, it would be a mistake to reduce our income. If we are very frugal and efficient, it is worth reconsidering this proposal.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that this proposal will have a significant increase in network security through staking, and I disagree with the premise that we should consider the value of our treasury at higher than current ADA prices. Additionally, I think that it would be a mistake to restrict our treasury income before this government has demonstrated it's style of spending those funds."
